By converting WebP images to JPEG or PNG, you ensure compatibility with a broader range of devices, applications, and browsers that may not natively support WebP.

4. **Web development and optimization:** While WebP offers superior image compression and smaller file sizes compared to JPEG or PNG, there might be situations where you need to convert WebP images to JPEG or PNG. This could be due to specific requirements of a content management system, integration with third-party services, or compatibility with certain browsers that do not support WebP.

5. **File size optimization:** In some cases, WebP images may have been encoded or compressed with settings that result in larger file sizes compared to JPEG or PNG counterparts. Converting WebP images to JPEG or PNG allows you to experiment with different compression settings and achieve better file size optimization for your specific use case.
